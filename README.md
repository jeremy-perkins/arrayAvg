# arrayAvg
Hello my name is Jeremy Perkins, this assignment is from Java Programming - COP 2805C. I'm uploading this as I'm currently taking CEN 3024C-31950.

This program declares 4 arrays, averages them seperately based on type, and prints as an output the averages. By creating a method to do this we are able to call on it for all 4 outputs, reducing the amount of code needing to be written.
